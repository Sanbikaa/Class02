# Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)
- (table) The (table) element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
- (tr) You indicate the start of each row using the opening (tr) tag. (The tr stands for table row.)
- (td) Each cell of a table is represented using a (td) element (The td stands for table data.)
- (th) The (th) element is used just like the (td) element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)
- (thead) The headings of the table should sit inside the (thead) element. 
- (tbody) The body should sit inside the (tbody) element.
- (tfoot) The footer belongs inside the (tfoot) element.

<h2>Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A function declaration creates a function that you can call later in your code. It is the type of function you have seen so far in this book.</li>
  <li> If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression, and it is known as a function expression.</li>
  <li> The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. You can then add properties and methods to the object.</li>
  <li> Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object’s properties and methods.</li>
  <li> You create instances of the object using the constructor function. The new keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object. The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.</li>
  <li> When a function is created at the top level of a script (that is, not inside another object or function), then it is in the global scope or global context</li>
  <li> All global variables also become properties of the window object, so when a function is in the global context, you can access global variables using the window object, as well as its other properties.</li>
  </ul>
