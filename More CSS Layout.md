# Layouts
- Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
- When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
- Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
- When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap.
- The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
- Width: This sets the width of the columns.
- Float: This positions the columns next to each other.
- margin: This creates a gap between the columns.
