# Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
- (Form) Form controls live inside a (form) element. This element.

- (method) Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
- (input) The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.
- type="text" When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a single line text input.
- (name) When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. 
- (maxlength) You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field. 
- (input type="password") When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out. 
- (textarea) The (textarea) element is used to create a mutli-line text input.
- (input type="radio") Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.
- (input type="checkbox) Checkboxes allow users to select (and unselect) one or more options in answer to a question.
- type="file" This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a browse button.

### Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

- Events are said to trigger a function or script. 
- All modern browsers understand this way of creating an event handler, but you can only attach one function to each event handler.
- Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events.
- The first line of this example shows the updated checkUsernameO function.TheminLength
- HTML elements nest inside other elements. If you hover or click on a link, you will also be hovering or clicking on its parent elements.
- The flow of events only really matters when your code has event handlers on an element and one of its ancestor or descendant elements.
