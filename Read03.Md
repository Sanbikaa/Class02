# Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
- The definition list is created with the (dl) element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
- Inside the (dl) element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and (dd) elements.
- (dt) This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
- (dd) This is used to contain the definition.
- You can put a second list inside an (li) element to create a sublist or nested list.
- Links are created using the (a) element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing (/a) tag.
- You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
- Links are created using the (a) element which has an attribute called href.
- Mail to: To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the (a) element
- Target: If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening (a) tag.

  <h2>Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)</h2>
 - CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
 - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
 - CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control.
 - the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.
 - Normal Flow: Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. 
 - Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
 - Absoulte Postitoning: This positions the element in relation to its containing element.
 - To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.
 - In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
 - Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
 - When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
 - Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
 - When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page. 
 - The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
 - A lot of layouts place boxes next to each other. The float property is commonly used to achieve this.
 - The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or right hand sides of a box. It can take the following values:
 - Left: The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element.
 - Right: The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
 - Both: Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements appearing in the same containing element.
 - None: Elements can touch either side.

  <ul>
 <li>Functions & Methods: Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. A method is the same as a function, except methods are created inside (and are part of) an object.</li>
    <li>Objetcs: objects are made up of properties and methods.</li>
    <li>Built-In Objects: The browser comes with a set of objects that act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.</li>
