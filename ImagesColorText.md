# Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
- (Img) To add an image into the page you need to use an (img) element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
- (Src) This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
- (alt) This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
- (title) You can also use the title attribute with the (img) element to provide additional information bout the image.
- (height) This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
- (width) This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
- (align) The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.
- (figure) Images often come with captions
- (figcaption) The (figcaption) element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

<h2> Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)</h2>

- color: The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
- RGB values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
- Hex Codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
- Color Names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan
- Hue: This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
- Saturation: This is expressed as a percentage.
- Lightness: This is expressed as a This is expressed as a 50% being normal, and 100% being black
- Alpha: This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.

<h2>Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)</h2>

- Font-Family: The user's computer needs the typeface installed. CSS is used to specify the typeface.
- Font-Face: CSS specifies where a font can CSS specifies where a font can installed on the computer.
- Service-Based Font-Face: Commercial services give users access to a wider range of fonts using @font-face.
- Sifr: The font is embedded into a Flash movie, and JavaScript replaces specified HTML text with a flash version of it.
- Cunfon: Cufon offers similar functionality to sIFR. It uses JavaScript to create either an SVG or VML version of the text.- Pixels: 
- Pixels: Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px.
- Percentages: The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.
- Ems: An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
- src: This specifies the path to the font. In order for this technique to work in all browsers, you will probably need to specify paths to a few different versions of the font, as shown on the next page.
- format: This specifies the format that the font is supplied in. (It's discussed in detail on the next page.)
- normal: This causes text to appear at a normal weight.
- bold: This causes text to appear bold.
- uppercase: This causes the text to appear uppercase.
- lowercase: This causes the text to appear lowercase.
- capitalize: This causes the first letter of each word to appear capitalized.
- none: This removes any decoration already applied to the text.
- underline: This adds a line underneath the text.
- overline: This adds a line over the top of the text.
- line-through: This adds a line through words.
- blink: This adds a line through words flash on and off (however this is generally frowned upon, as it is considered rather annoying).
