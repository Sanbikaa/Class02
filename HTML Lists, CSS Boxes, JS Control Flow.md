# Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

- The ordered list is created with the (ol) element
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening (li) tag and a closing (/li) tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
- The unordered list is created with the (ul) element.
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening (li) tag and a closing (/li) tag. (The li
stands for list item.)
- The definition list is created with the (dl) element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
- Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of (dt) and (dd) elements.

  <h2>Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents.</li>
    <li>The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems( emphasized text)</li>
    <li>Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen.</li>
    <li>The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself It can have one of two values:</li>
    <li>Hidden this property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box</li>
    <li>Scroll this property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.</li>
    <li>The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given n pixels or using one of the following values:</li>
    <li>Thin</li>
    <li>Medium</li>
    <li>Thick</li>
    <li>You can control the individual size of borders using four separate properties:</li>
    <li>border-top-width</li>
    <li>border-right-width</li>
    <li>border-bottom-width</li>
    <li>border-left-width</li>
    <li>You can control the style of a border using the border-style property. This property can take the following values:</li>
    <li>solid a single solid line</li>
   <li>dotted a series of square dots</li>
   <li>dashed a series of short lines</li>
   <li>double two solid lines (the value of the border-width property creates the sum of the two lines)</li>
   <li>groove appears to be carved into the page</li>
   <li>ridge appears to stick out from the page</li>
   <li>inset appears embedded into the page</li>
   <li>outset looks like it is coming out of the screen</li>
   <li>hidden / none no border is shown</li>
   <li>You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.</li>
  <li>You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable</li>
  <li>The Values are assinged to the arry inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma.</li>
  <li>The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array</li>
  <li>This is known as array literal. It is usually the preferred method for creating an array.</li>
  <li>Example:</li>
  <li><p>var colors = new Array("white","black", "custom");</p>
   <p>var el = document.getElmementById('colors");</p>
   el.textContent= colors[0];</li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>The if....else statement checks a condition</li>
  <li>If it resolves to true the first code block is executed</li>
  <li>If the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead.</li>
  <li>A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value</li>
  <li>Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run.</li>
