<h2>Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Concise: Ideally, the navigation should be quick and easy to read.</li>
  <li>Clear: Users should be able to predict the kind of information that they will find on the page before clicking on the link.</li>
  <li>Selective: The primary navigation should only reflect the sections or content of the site.</li>
  <li>Context: Good navigation provides context. It lets the user know where they are in the website at that moment</li>
  <li>Interactive: Each link should be big enough to click on and the appearance of the link should change when the user hovers over each item or clicks on it.</li>
  <li>Consistent: The more pages a site contains, the larger the number of navigation items there will be. Although secondary navigation will change from page to page, it is best to keep the primary navigation exactly the same.</li>
